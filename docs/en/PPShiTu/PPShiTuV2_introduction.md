## 3 Module introduction and training

### 3.1 Mainbody detection

Mainbody detection is a widely used detection technology. It refers to detecting the coordinate position of one or more objects in the image, and then cropping the corresponding area in the image for identification. Mainbody detection is the pre-procedure of the recognition task. The input image is recognized after mainbody detection, which can remove complex backgrounds and effectively improve the recognition accuracy.

Taking into account the detection speed, model size, detection accuracy and other factors, the lightweight model `PicoDet-LCNet_x2_5` developed by PaddleDetection was finally selected as the mainbody detection model of PP-ShiTuV2

For details on the dataset, training, evaluation, inference, etc. of the mainbody detection model, please refer to the document: [picodet_lcnet_x2_5_640_mainbody](../../en/image_recognition_pipeline/mainbody_detection_en.md).

### 3.2 Feature Extraction

Feature extraction is a key part of image recognition. It is designed to convert the input image into a fixed-dimensional feature vector for subsequent [vector search](../../en/image_recognition_pipeline/vector_search_en.md) . Taking into account the speed of the feature extraction model, model size, feature extraction performance and other factors, the [`PPLCNetV2_base`](../../en/models/PP-LCNet_en.md) developed by PaddleClas was finally selected as the feature extraction network. Compared with `PPLCNet_x2_5` used by PP-ShiTuV1, `PPLCNetV2_base` basically maintains high classification accuracy and reduces inference time by 40%<sup>*</sup>.

**Note:** <sup>*</sup>The inference environment is based on Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6271C CPU @ 2.60GHz hardware platform, OpenVINO inference platform.

During the experiment, we found that we can make appropriate improvements to `PPLCNetV2_base` to achieve higher performance in recognition tasks while keeping the speed basically unchanged, including: removing `ReLU` and `FC` at the end of `PPLCNetV2_base`, change the stride of the last stage (RepDepthwiseSeparable) to 1.

For details about the dataset, training, evaluation, inference, etc. of the feature extraction model, please refer to the document: [PPLCNetV2_base_ShiTu](../../en/image_recognition_pipeline/feature_extraction_en.md).

### 3.3 Vector Search

Vector Search technology is widely used in image recognition. Its' main goal is to calculate the similarity or distance of the feature vector in the established vector database for a given query vector, and return the similarity ranking result of the candidate vector.

In the PP-ShiTuV2 recognition system, we use the [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) vector research open source library, which has good adaptability, easy installation, rich algorithms, It supports the advantages of both CPU and GPU.

For the installation and use of the Faiss vector research tool in the PP-ShiTuV2 system, please refer to the document: [vector search](../../en/image_recognition_pipeline/vector_search_en.md).

## 4. Inference Deployment

### 4.1 Inference model preparation
Paddle Inference is the native inference database of Paddle, which enabled on the server and the cloud to provide high-performance inference capabilities. Compared to making predictions based on pre-trained models directly, Paddle Inference can use MKLDNN, CUDNN, and TensorRT for prediction acceleration to achieve better inference performance. For more introduction to Paddle Inference inference engine, please refer to [Paddle Inference official website tutorial](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/zh/guides/infer/inference/inference_cn.html).

When using Paddle Inference for model inference, the loaded model type is the inference model. This case provides two methods to obtain the inference model. If you want to get the same result as the document, please click [Download the inference model directly](#412-download-the-inference-model-directly).

#### 4.1.1 Export the inference model from pretrained model
- Please refer to the document [Mainbody Detection Inference Model Preparation](../../en/image_recognition_pipeline/mainbody_detection_en.md), or refer to [4.1.2](#412-direct download-inference-model)

- To export the weights of the feature extraction model, you can refer to the following commands:
  ```shell
  python3.7 tools/export_model.py \
  -c ./ppcls/configs/GeneralRecognitionV2/GeneralRecognitionV2_PPLCNetV2_base.yaml \
  -o Global.pretrained_model="https://paddle-imagenet-models-name.bj.bcebos.com/dygraph/rec/models/pretrain/PPShiTuV2/general_PPLCNetV2_base_pretrained_v1.0.pdparams" \
  -o Global.save_inference_dir=deploy/models/GeneralRecognitionV2_PPLCNetV2_base`
  ```
  After executing the script, the `GeneralRecognitionV2_PPLCNetV2_base` folder will be generated under `deploy/models/` with the following file structure:

  ```log
  deploy/models/
  ├── GeneralRecognitionV2_PPLCNetV2_base
  │   ├── inference.pdiparams
  │   ├── inference.pdiparams.info
  │   └── inference.pdmodel
  ```

#### 4.1.2 Download the inference model directly

[Section 4.1.1](#411-export-the-inference-model-from-pretrained-model) provides a method to export the inference model, here we provide the exported inference model, you can download the model to the specified location and decompress it by the following command experience.

```shell
cd deploy/models

# Download the mainbody detection inference model and unzip it
wget -nc https://paddle-imagenet-models-name.bj.bcebos.com/dygraph/rec/models/inference/picodet_PPLCNet_x2_5_mainbody_lite_v1.0_infer.tar && tar -xf picodet_PPLCNet_x2_5_mainbody_lite_v1.0_infer.tar

# Download the feature extraction inference model and unzip it
wget -nc https://paddle-imagenet-models-name.bj.bcebos.com/dygraph/rec/models/inference/PP-ShiTuV2/general_PPLCNetV2_base_pretrained_v1.0_infer.tar && tar -xf general_PPLCNetV2_base_pretrained_v1.tar
```

### 4.2 Test data preparation

After preparing the mainbody detection and feature extraction models, you also need to prepare the test data as input. You can run the following commands to download and decompress the test data.

```shell
# return to ./deploy
cd ../

# Download the test data drink_dataset_v2.0 and unzip it
wget -nc https://paddle-imagenet-models-name.bj.bcebos.com/dygraph/rec/data/drink_dataset_v2.0.tar && tar -xf drink_dataset_v2.0.tar
```

### 4.3 Inference based on Python inference engine

#### 4.3.1 single image prediction

Then execute the following command to identify the single image `./drink_dataset_v2.0/test_images/100.jpeg`.

```shell
# Execute the following command to predict with GPU
python3.7 python/predict_system.py -c configs/inference_general.yaml -o Global.infer_imgs="./drink_dataset_v2.0/test_images/100.jpeg"

# Execute the following command to predict with CPU
python3.7 python/predict_system.py -c configs/inference_general.yaml -o Global.infer_imgs="./drink_dataset_v2.0/test_images/100.jpeg" -o Global.use_gpu=False
```

The final output is as follows.

```log
[{'bbox': [437, 71, 660, 728], 'rec_docs': '元气森林', 'rec_scores': 0.7740249}, {'bbox': [221, 72, 449, 701], 'rec_docs': '元气森林', 'rec_scores': 0.6950992}, {'bbox': [794, 104, 979, 652], 'rec_docs': '元气森林', 'rec_scores': 0.6305153}]
```

#### 4.3.2 multi images prediction

If you want to predict the images in the folder, you can directly modify the `Global.infer_imgs` field in the configuration file, or you can modify the corresponding configuration through the following -o parameter.

```shell
# Use the command below to predict with GPU
python3.7 python/predict_system.py -c configs/inference_general.yaml -o Global.infer_imgs="./drink_dataset_v2.0/test_images"
# Use the following command to predict with CPU
python3.7 python/predict_system.py -c configs/inference_general.yaml -o Global.infer_imgs="./drink_dataset_v2.0/test_images" -o Global.use_gpu=False
```

The terminal will output the recognition results of all images in the folder, as shown below.

```log
...
[{'bbox': [0, 0, 600, 600], 'rec_docs': '红牛-强化型', 'rec_scores': 0.74081033}]
