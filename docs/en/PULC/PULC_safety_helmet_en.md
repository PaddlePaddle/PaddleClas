## 1. Introduction

This case provides a way for users to quickly build a lightweight, high-precision and practical classification model of wheather wearing safety helmet using PaddleClas PULC (Practical Ultra Lightweight image Classification). The model can be widely used in construction scenes, factory workshop scenes, traffic scenes and so on.

The following table lists the relevant indicators of the model. The first three lines means that using SwinTransformer_tiny, Res2Net200_vd_26w_4s and MobileNetV3_small_x0_35 as the backbone to training. The fourth to seventh lines means that the backbone is replaced by PPLCNet, additional use of EDA strategy and additional use of EDA strategy and SKL-UGI knowledge distillation strategy.

| Backbone | Tpr(%) | Latency(ms) | Size(M)| Training Strategy |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| SwinTranformer_tiny  | 93.57 | 91.32  | 111 | using ImageNet pretrained model |
| Res2Net200_vd_26w_4s  | 98.92 | 80.99 | 284 | using ImageNet pretrained model |
| MobileNetV3_small_x0_35  | 84.83 | 2.85 | 2.6 | using ImageNet pretrained model |
| PPLCNet_x1_0  | 93.27 | 2.03  | 7.1 | using ImageNet pretrained model |
| PPLCNet_x1_0  | 98.16 | 2.03  | 7.1 | using SSLD pretrained model |
| PPLCNet_x1_0  | 99.30 | 2.03  | 7.1 | using SSLD pretrained model + EDA strategy  |
| <b>PPLCNet_x1_0<b>  | <b>99.38<b> | <b>2.03<b>  | <b>7.1<b> | using SSLD pretrained model + EDA strategy + SKL-UGI knowledge distillation strategy|

It can be seen that high Tpr can be getted when backbone is Res2Net200_vd_26w_4s, but the speed is slow. Replacing backbone with the lightweight model MobileNetV3_small_x0_35, the speed can be greatly improved, but the Tpr will be greatly reduced. Replacing backbone with faster backbone PPLCNet_x1_0, the Tpr is higher more 8.5 percentage points than MobileNetv3_small_x0_35. At the same time, the speed can be more than 20% faster. After additional using the SSLD pretrained model, the Tpr can be improved by about 4.9 percentage points without affecting the inference speed. Further, additional using the EDA strategy, the Tpr can be increased by 1.1 percentage points. Finally, after additional using the UDML knowledge distillation, the Tpr can be further improved by 2.2 percentage points. At this point, the Tpr is higher than that of Res2Net200_vd_26w_4s, but the speed is more than 70 times faster. The training method and deployment instructions of PULC will be introduced in detail below.

**Note**:

* About `Tpr` metric, please refer to [3.2 section](#3.2) for more information .
* The Latency is tested on Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6148 CPU @ 2.40GHz. The MKLDNN is enabled and the number of threads is 10.

## 2. Quick Start

<a name="2.1"></a>  

### 2.1 PaddlePaddle Installation

- Run the following command to install if CUDA9 or CUDA10 is available.

```bash
python3 -m pip install paddlepaddle-gpu -i https://mirror.baidu.com/pypi/simple
```

- Run the following command to install if GPU device is unavailable.

```bash
python3 -m pip install paddlepaddle -i https://mirror.baidu.com/pypi/simple
```

Please refer to [PaddlePaddle Installation](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick?docurl=/documentation/docs/en/install/pip/linux-pip_en.html) for more information about installation, for examples other versions.

<a name="2.2"></a>  

### 2.2 PaddleClas wheel Installation

The command of PaddleClas installation as bellow:

```bash
pip3 install paddleclas
```

<a name="2.3"></a>

### 2.3 Prediction

First, please click [here](https://paddleclas.bj.bcebos.com/data/PULC/pulc_demo_imgs.zip) to download and unzip to get the test demo images.

* Prediction with CLI

```bash
paddleclas --model_name=safety_helmet --infer_imgs=pulc_demo_imgs/safety_helmet/safety_helmet_test_1.png
```

Results:

```
>>> result
class_ids: [1], scores: [0.9986255], label_names: ['unwearing_helmet'], filename: pulc_demo_imgs/safety_helmet/safety_helmet_test_1.png
Predict complete!
```
**Note**: If you want to test other images, only need to specify the `--infer_imgs` argument, and the directory containing images is also supported.

* Prediction in Python

```python
import paddleclas
model = paddleclas.PaddleClas(model_name="safety_helmet")
result = model.predict(input_data="pulc_demo_imgs/safety_helmet/safety_helmet_test_1.png")
print(next(result))
```

**Note**: The `result` returned by `model.predict()` is a generator, so you need to use the `next()` function to call it or `for` loop to loop it. And it will predict with `batch_size` size batch and return the prediction results when called. The default `batch_size` is 1, and you also specify the `batch_size` when instantiating, such as `model = paddleclas.PaddleClas(model_name="safety_helmet",  batch_size=2)`. The result of demo above:

```
>>> result
[{'class_ids': [1], 'scores': [0.9986255], 'label_names': ['unwearing_helmet'], 'filename': 'pulc_demo_imgs/safety_helmet/safety_helmet_test_1.png'}]
```

## 3. Training, Evaluation and Inference

<a name="3.1"></a>  

### 3.1 Installation

Please refer to [Installation](../installation/install_paddleclas_en.md) to get the description about installation.

<a name="3.2"></a>

### 3.2 Dataset

<a name="3.2.1"></a>

#### 3.2.1 Dataset Introduction

All datasets used in this case are open source data. Train data is the subset of [Safety-Helmet-Wearing-Dataset](https://github.com/njvisionpower/Safety-Helmet-Wearing-Dataset), [hard-hat-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/hard-hat-detection) and [Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).

<a name="3.2.2"></a>  

#### 3.2.2 Getting Dataset

The data used in this case can be getted by processing the open source data. The detailed processes are as follows:

* `Safety-Helmet-Wearing-Dataset`: according to the bbox label data, the image is cropped by enlarging width and height of bbox by 3 times. The label is 0 if wearing safety helmet in the image, and the label is 1 if not;
* `hard-hat-detection`: Only use the image that labeled "hat" and crop it with bbox. The label is 0;
* `CelebA`: Only use the image labeled "wearing_hat" and crop it with bbox. The label is 0;

After processing, the dataset totals about 150000 images, of which the number of images with and without wearing safety helmet is about 28000 and 121000 respectively. Then 5600 images are randomly selected in the two labels as the valuation data, a total of about 11200 images, and about 138000 other images as the training data.

Some image of the processed dataset is as follows:

![](../../images/PULC/docs/safety_helmet_data_demo.jpg)

And you can also download the data processed directly.

```
cd path_to_PaddleClas
```

Enter the `dataset/` directory, download and unzip the dataset.

```shell
cd dataset
wget https://paddleclas.bj.bcebos.com/data/PULC/safety_helmet.tar
tar -xf safety_helmet.tar
cd ../
```

The datas under `safety_helmet` directory:

```
├── images
│   ├── VOC2028_part2_001209_1.jpg
│   ├── HHD_hard_hat_workers23_1.jpg
│   ├── CelebA_077809.jpg
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── train_list.txt
└── val_list.txt
```

The `train_list.txt` and `val_list.txt` are label files of training data and validation data respectively. All images in `images/` directory.

**Note**:

* About the contents format of `train_list.txt` and `val_list.txt`, please refer to [Description about Classification Dataset in PaddleClas](../data_preparation/classification_dataset_en.md).

<a name="3.3"></a>

### 3.3 Training

The details of training config in `ppcls/configs/PULC/person_exists/PPLCNet_x1_0.yaml`. The command about training as follows:

```shell
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
python3 -m paddle.distributed.launch \
    --gpus="0,1,2,3" \
    tools/train.py \
    -c ./ppcls/configs/PULC/safety_helmet/PPLCNet_x1_0.yaml
```

The best metric of validation data is between `0.985` and `0.993`. There would be fluctuations because the data size is small.

**Note**:

* The metric Tpr, that describe the True Positive Rate when False Positive Rate is less than a certain threshold(1/10000 used in this case), is one of the commonly used metric for binary classification. About the details of Fpr and Tpr, please refer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic).
* When evaluation, the best metric TprAtFpr will be printed that include `Fpr`, `Tpr` and the current `threshold`. The `Tpr` means the Recall rate under the current `Fpr`. The `Tpr` higher, the model better. The `threshold` would be used in deployment, which means the classification threshold under best `Fpr` metric.

### 3.4 Evaluation

After training, you can use the following commands to evaluate the model.


```bash
python3 tools/eval.py \
    -c ./ppcls/configs/PULC/safety_helmet/PPLCNet_x1_0.yaml \
    -o Global.pretrained_model=output/PPLCNet_x1_0/best_model

```

**备注：**

* Among the above command, argument `-o Global.pretrained_model="output/PPLCNet_x1_0/best_model"` specify the path of the best model weight file. You can specify other path if needed.
* The default test image is `deploy/images/PULC/safety_helmet/safety_helmet_test_1.png`. And you can test other image, only need to specify the argument `-o Infer.infer_imgs=path_to_test_image`.
* The default threshold is `0.5`. If needed, you can specify the argument `Infer.PostProcess.threshold`, such as: `-o Infer.PostProcess.threshold=0.9167`. And the argument `threshold` is needed to be specified according by specific case. The `0.9167` is the best threshold when `Fpr` is less than `1/10000` in this valuation dataset.
