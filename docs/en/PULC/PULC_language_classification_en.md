## 1. Introduction

This case provides a way for users to quickly build a lightweight, high-precision and practical classification model of language in the image using PaddleClas PULC (Practical Ultra Lightweight image Classification). The model can be widely used in various scenarios involving multilingual OCR processing, such as finance and government affairs.

The following table lists the relevant indicators of the model. The first two lines means that using SwinTransformer_tiny and MobileNetV3_small_x0_35 as the backbone to training. The third to sixth lines means that the backbone is replaced by PPLCNet, additional use of EDA strategy and additional use of EDA strategy and SKL-UGI knowledge distillation strategy. When replacing the backbone with PPLCNet_x1_0, the input shape of model is changed to [192, 48], and the stride of the network is changed to [2, [2, 1], [2, 1], [2, 1]].

| Backbone | Top1-Acc(%) | Latency(ms) | Size(M)| Training Strategy |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| SwinTranformer_tiny     | 98.12     | 89.09    | 111     | using ImageNet pretrained model |
| MobileNetV3_small_x0_35 | 95.92     | 2.98     | 3.7      | using ImageNet pretrained model |
| PPLCNet_x1_0            | 98.35     | 2.58     | 7.1     | using ImageNet pretrained model |
| PPLCNet_x1_0            | 98.7      | 2.58     | 7.1     | using SSLD pretrained model |
| PPLCNet_x1_0            | 99.12     | 2.58     | 7.1     | using SSLD pretrained model + EDA strategy  |
| **PPLCNet_x1_0**        | **99.26** | **2.58** | **7.1** | using SSLD pretrained model + EDA strategy + SKL-UGI knowledge distillation strategy|

It can be seen that high accuracy can be getted when backbone is SwinTranformer_tiny, but the speed is slow. Replacing backbone with the lightweight model MobileNetV3_small_x0_35, the speed can be greatly improved, but the accuracy will be greatly reduced. Replacing backbone with faster backbone PPLCNet_x1_0 and changing the input shape and stride of network, the accuracy is higher more 2.43 percentage points than MobileNetv3_small_x0_35. At the same time, the speed can be more than 20% faster. After additional using the SSLD pretrained model, the accuracy can be improved by about 0.35 percentage points without affecting the inference speed. Further, additional using the EDA strategy, the accuracy can be increased by 0.42 percentage points. Finally, after additional using the SKL-UGI knowledge distillation, the accuracy can be further improved by 0.14 percentage points. At this point, the accuracy is higher than that of SwinTranformer_tiny, but the speed is more faster. The training method and deployment instructions of PULC will be introduced in detail below.

**Note**:

* The Latency is tested on Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6148 CPU @ 2.40GHz. The MKLDNN is enabled and the number of threads is 10.
* About PP-LCNet, please refer to [PP-LCNet Introduction](../models/PP-LCNet_en.md) and [PP-LCNet Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15099).

## 2. Quick Start

<a name="2.1"></a>  

### 2.1 PaddlePaddle Installation

- Run the following command to install if CUDA9 or CUDA10 is available.

```bash
python3 -m pip install paddlepaddle-gpu -i https://mirror.baidu.com/pypi/simple
```

- Run the following command to install if GPU device is unavailable.

```bash
python3 -m pip install paddlepaddle -i https://mirror.baidu.com/pypi/simple
```

Please refer to [PaddlePaddle Installation](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick?docurl=/documentation/docs/en/install/pip/linux-pip_en.html) for more information about installation, for examples other versions.

<a name="2.2"></a>  

### 2.2 PaddleClas wheel Installation

The command of PaddleClas installation as bellow:

```bash
pip3 install paddleclas
```

<a name="2.3"></a>

### 2.3 Prediction

First, please click [here](https://paddleclas.bj.bcebos.com/data/PULC/pulc_demo_imgs.zip) to download and unzip to get the test demo images.

* Prediction with CLI

```bash
paddleclas --model_name=language_classification --infer_imgs=pulc_demo_imgs/language_classification/word_35404.png
```

Results:

```
>>> result
class_ids: [4, 6], scores: [0.88672, 0.01434], label_names: ['japan', 'korean'], filename: pulc_demo_imgs/language_classification/word_35404.png
Predict complete!
```

**Note**: If you want to test other images, only need to specify the `--infer_imgs` argument, and the directory containing images is also supported.

* Prediction in Python

```python
import paddleclas
model = paddleclas.PaddleClas(model_name="language_classification")
result = model.predict(input_data="pulc_demo_imgs/language_classification/word_35404.png")
print(next(result))
```

**Note**: The `result` returned by `model.predict()` is a generator, so you need to use the `next()` function to call it or `for` loop to loop it. And it will predict with `batch_size` size batch and return the prediction results when called. The default `batch_size` is 1, and you also specify the `batch_size` when instantiating, such as `model = paddleclas.PaddleClas(model_name="language_classification",  batch_size=2)`. The result of demo above:

```
>>> result
[{'class_ids': [4, 6], 'scores': [0.88672, 0.01434], 'label_names': ['japan', 'korean'], 'filename': 'pulc_demo_imgs/language_classification/word_35404.png'}]
```

### 3.2 Dataset

<a name="3.2.1"></a>

#### 3.2.1 Dataset Introduction

The models wo provided are trained with internal data, which is not open source yet. So it is suggested that constructing dataset based on open source dataset [Multi-lingual scene text detection and recognition](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=15&com=downloads) to experience the this case.

Some image of the processed dataset is as follows:

![](../../images/PULC/docs/language_classification_original_data.png)

<a name="3.2.2"></a>  

#### 3.2.2 Getting Dataset

The models provided support to classcify 10 languages, which as shown in the following list:

`0` : means Arabic
`1` : means chinese_cht
`2` : means cyrillic
`3` : means devanagari
`4` : means Japanese
`5` : means ka
`6` : means Korean
`7` : means ta
`8` : means te
`9` : means Latin

In the `Multi-lingual scene text detection and recognition`, only Arabic, Japanese, Korean and Latin data are included. 1600 images from each of the four languages are taken as the training data of this case, 300 images as the evaluation data, and 400 images as the supplementary data is used for the `SKL-UGI Knowledge Distillation`.

Therefore, for the demo dataset in this case, the language categories are shown in following list:
`0` : means arabic
`4` : means japan
`6` : means korean
`9` : means latin

**Note**: The images used in this task should be cropped by text from original image. Only the text line part is used as the image data.

If you want to create your own dataset, you can collect and sort out the data of the required languages in your task as required. And you can also download the data processed directly.

```
cd path_to_PaddleClas
```

Enter the `dataset/` directory, download and unzip the dataset.

```shell
cd dataset
wget https://paddleclas.bj.bcebos.com/data/PULC/language_classification.tar
tar -xf language_classification.tar
cd ../
```

The datas under `language_classification` directory:

```
├── img
│   ├── word_1.png
│   ├── word_2.png
...
├── train_list.txt
├── train_list_for_distill.txt
├── test_list.txt
└── label_list.txt
```

Where `img/` is the directory including 9200 images in 4 languages. The `train_list.txt` and `test_list.txt` are label files of training data and validation data respectively. `label_list.txt` is the mapping file corresponding to the four languages. `train_list_for_distill.txt` is the label list of images used for `SKL-UGI Knowledge Distillation`.

**Note**:

* About the contents format of `train_list.txt` and `val_list.txt`, please refer to [Description about Classification Dataset in PaddleClas](../data_preparation/classification_dataset_en.md).
