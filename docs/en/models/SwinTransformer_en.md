## 1. Overview
Swin Transformer a new vision Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. It is a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection.
